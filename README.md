### Hi there 👋

I'm a software engineer at [Veylinx](https://veylinx.com) who is passionate about Javascript and all of its frameworks and automating the shit out of things. I'm also on a journey to create ideas, products or information that will actually help others. When I'm not at my desk, you can usually find me either at a mountain-top ⛰️, deep in the ocean 🏊‍♂️ or in the kitchen making a tasty coffee ☕.

- 💬 Ask me about React/JS, SaaS, Notion, or Moroccan food.
- 📫 How to reach me: DM me @faridouachrar or email me at farid.ouachrar@gmail.com
